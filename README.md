# Chroma-Hash

Password entry can be frustrating, 
especially with long or difficult passwords. 
On a webpage, secure fields obscure your input with â€¢'s so others can't read it. 
Unfortunately, neither can you --- 
you can't tell if you got your password right until you click "Log In".

Chroma-Hash is a jQuery plugin that visualizes secure text-field values using ambient color bars.

Chroma-Hash displays a series of colored bars at the end of field inputs 
so you can instantly tell if your password is right. 
The script takes a hash of your input to compute the colors in the visualization;
the resulting color pattern is non-reversible, 
so no one can determine your password from the colors alone.

## Usage

```javascript
$("input:password").chromaHash({bars: 3, salt:"7be82b35cb0199120eea35a4507c9acf", minimum:6});
```

- `bars` : the number of bars displayed (1, 2, 3, or 4)
- `salt` : the value to be appended when calculating hash function
- `minimum` : the minimum number of characters needed for grayscale bars to be displayed in color

## Requirements

- jQuery 1.3+
